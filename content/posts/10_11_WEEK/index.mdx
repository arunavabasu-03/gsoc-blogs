# Unit Selection
Previously radis only supports the fixed arbitary units [cm-1(wavelength range) , bar(pressure) ..] , but now user can chose the units from the interface what they are want to use.

# Bugs Fixes
After integrating the unit selection features we have some bugs in the radis app . Basically their is another feature that is integrated by @suzil [overlay spectra], so it is creating some conflicts in the radis app. So we have to fix those bugs.
