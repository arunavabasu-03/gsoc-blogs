### React 18 Migration

Because Radis is currently using an outdated version of React, we have chosen to upgrade to React 18.

```tsx
//pakage.json
{
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}
```

```tsx
//index.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement
); //new way 
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
### Linting and type checking setup

In essence, there aren't any `github actions` set up in the Radis App that check the code on every push, and with bigger codebases, it's impossible to manually inspect the new code with each new push.

Since the Radis app uses `Eslint` to examine the `linting`, there are already preconfigured guidelines , making it less complicated.

First of all , we  set up the `node environment` into the `runner` using github actions, then we execute the `yarn lint` command to verify the linting.

Because the Radis app uses `TypeScript`, so  we check  the types using `yarn type-check`.

```bash
# linting check of radis-app
name: Linting Check for Radis-App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run-linters:
    name: Run linters
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run linters
        run: cd frontend && yarn lint
      - name: type check
        run: cd frontend && yarn type-check
```

### MUI^5 Migration

The earlier version of the Radis app uses MUI 4, however because MUI 5 has some significant improvements, we chose to upgrade for improved support and additional features.

New features :

1.  The `sx`  prop (The material-ui team has replaced `makeStyles` with a much simpler and much better API in v5: sx prop)
2. Better TypeScript Support .
