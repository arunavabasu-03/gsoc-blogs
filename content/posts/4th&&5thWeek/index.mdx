After analyzing the the benchmarks and taking with my mentors , we are decided to go with `React Hook Form` for itâ€™s performace , low package size etc .. 

                            Their is many ways to integrate  React Hook form in the app , using `useFormContext` (easy way no need pass `props`)and  using `Controller`  . After analylizing both ways i decied to go with `Controller` because `useFormContext` has some performance issues . For validation we use `yup` to validate the fields.
