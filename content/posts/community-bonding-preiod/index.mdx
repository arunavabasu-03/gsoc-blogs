Really, don't believe it; it almost seems miraculous. But hey !! I get chosen. My mentors and fellow contributors are congratulating me. During the **Community Bonding Period**, I have made significant progress in my comprehension of the Radis App code . Discussing all of the approaches and what should be most suitable for the Radis app with my mentors, taking with my other contributors to understand their project and their plans, and preparing all of the things I'm going to do to achieve in this summer  and meet the deadlines.
My mentors and all of my other contributors were very interactive , really have a great fun .

## **About My project**

#### Name: Radis App Improvement

**RADIS app is a web app for high-resolution infrared molecular spectra using RADIS. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use UI instead of writing code. Currently, the RADIS app has a simple interface with basic functionalities that helps create a nice spectral graph using certain parameters but there is a lot of scope for improvements. The goal of this project is to create a more responsive app while improving and implementing new features and fixing various issues.**
